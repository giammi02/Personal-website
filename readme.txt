Why isn't bootstrap included in this project?
There are specific reasons for which i decided not to use bootstrap in my project
> first of all, before this project i wasn't so fluid in writing css/scss, therefore i decided to go deep in the practice of this language, avoiding the mistake of using bootstrap without really knowing css.
> i wanted to create a personal website with a particular personal touch, which is not always possible using basic version of bootstrap if you want a total control over your project.
